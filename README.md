# What to Watch!

This application will allow you to browse through over 100k movie reviews with a
few simple inputs.  

Please wait for prompts as the program loads.

Option 1 on the load screen will allow you to search by movie ID to see the
average ratings as well as total number of ratings for the movies.  Then it will
allow for title representation of the movie ID.  

Option 2 will allow you to sort by userID for ratings, and what that user gave
a specific movie's rating.

The program will loop until you hit q to exit.
